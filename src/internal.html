			<p>Andrew Fretwell, a world-renowned Chi Nei Tsang pracitioner, explains the power of this revolutionary therapy and the essence of all healing.
			In order to understand what healing will look like as we evolve as species into the 21st century we really need to understand the purpose of a human life.
			Every human being is unique and is absolutely essential to the whole of life, and if we are deeply honest there is something we are all longing for, and that is deep fulfilment. The biggest lie we were ever served is that fulfilment only comes when we have the “perfect life” and that the more we acquire the more fulfilled we will be. </p>

			<blockquote><p>“ To heal, we don’t need to be intelligent, we don’t need to be good, and we don’t need to deserve it. Healing is pure grace. To heal, we do need honesty. We need to be true to ourselves. We need to be able to admit that we have feelings we wish we didn’t have. We need to own these feelings so we can outgrow them, and so we can mature as human beings.”</p></blockquote>

			<p>So if faethis was true why are we as a species so deeply unsatisfied and unfulfilled? We certainly have much more now than our ancestors did and yet most of humanity is living in a constant state of stress and anxiety, chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease are affecting more and more people. Many people require medication to avoid feelings of deep depression and dissatisfaction.</p>

			<p>From the Chi Nei Tsang (CNT) perspective, fulfilment happens when we connect with our life purpose and start to express this. The famous Boston philharmonic music conductor Benjamin Zander shared his breakthrough moment at 45 when he realised as a conductor his job was to release and support the genius in others. He now travels the world educating teachers on how to uplift the children in their classes. Each of us has a specific purpose that only we can fulfil.
			Our purpose is already within us; it’s not something we have to work hard to achieve. It is deeply embedded in our hearts and DNA. 
			In truth, all healing is about learning to listen to our hearts, learning to trust the longing in our hearts. This also means becoming honest with oneself. If there is one simple requirement for healing, it is honesty. One of my colleagues in Chi Nei Tsang Gilles Marin, Director CNT Institute California puts it beautifully:
			“To heal, we don’t need to be intelligent, we don’t need to be good, and we don’t need to deserve it. Healing is pure grace. To heal, we do need honesty. We need to be true to ourselves. We need to be able to admit that we have feelings we wish we didn’t have. We need to own these feelings so we can outgrow them, and so we can mature as human beings.” 
			From my perspective all healing has to do with digesting hidden emotional charges in our bodies. All the things we don’t like about ourselves. In Chi Nei Tsang, we recognise that all symptoms are hidden emotional charges hiding in the body until such time as we have enough awareness and feel supported enough to get in touch with the pain stored there. It’s much easier to hold something on the physical level than to feel the emotional pain and original trauma. </p>
